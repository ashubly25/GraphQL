/*# GraphQL
Building Simple API*/
This project was meant for my basic understanding and implementation of the working of GraphQL.It is being used to perform basic Create, Read, Update & Delete.Trust me GraphQL crushes REST in every possible scenario. This is the thing for another league. 
All the data which are available is in JSON and it operates in JSON itself.
